<p>Photo labs only offer printing at standard sizes such as 6"×4" or 7"×5" but
sometimes you want to print your photos at different dimensions or ratios.
With OddPrints you can choose any size you like. You just download a transformed
image ready to print at a standard size, and cut down to the size you want.</p>
