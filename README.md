Who is it for?
--------------

OddPrints solves the problem of printing your photos for frames that do not match the standard sizes offered by printing labs.
It does this by allowing the user to upload a photo and enter the size of the frame. The user can then download a new image
which is their image with the correct padding and guidelines ready for printing at a standard size.
The user then cuts the image down to size with scissors.


How does it work?
-----------------

To simply generate the new image, the original image isn't actually uploaded at all, as it is transformed entirely in the browser using javascript.
